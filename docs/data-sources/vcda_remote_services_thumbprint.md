# vcda_remote_services_thumbprint (Data Source)

The remote services thumbprint data source has two functions:

- Computes the remote service's thumbprint in a SHA-256 format from a `pem_file` that contains the
  last certificate in the chain (end entity certificate) of the remote appliance/service in PEM format.
- Computes the remote service's thumbprint in a SHA-256 format from the provided address and port.
  **NOTE:** This method is quick and good for development purposes, but produces a thumbprint that is not verified nor
  safe for use.

## Example Usage

### Compute the thumbprint from a `pem_file`

```terraform
data "vcda_remote_services_thumbprint" "ls_thumbprint" {
  pem_file = "ls-cert.pem"
}
```

### Compute the thumbprint from `address` and `port` (NOT RECOMMENDED, but good for development purposes)

```terraform
data "vcda_remote_services_thumbprint" "ls_thumbprint" {
  address = var.lookup_service_address
  port    = "443"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `address` (String) The address of the remote appliance/service. **NOTE:** this method produces a thumbprint that is
  not verified nor safe for use.
- `port` (String) The port of the remote appliance/service. Use only with `address`.
- `pem_file` (String) The name of the file that contains the last certificate in the chain (end entity
  cert) of the remote appliance/service in PEM format.
  On creation, include either `pem_file` or `address`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The thumbprint of the remote service.

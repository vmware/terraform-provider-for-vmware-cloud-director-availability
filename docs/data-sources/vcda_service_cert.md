# vcda_service_cert (Data Source)

The service cert data source obtains the certificate from the VM's guest info extraConfig property.
The appliance exposes the certificate in a base64-encoded DER format, that is no PEM header nor footer and no new lines.
The output value of this resource is used as an argument in the different resources for performing secure HTTP requests.
In case of certificate mismatch, the requests fail
with `Failed to verify certificate x509: certificate signed by unknown authority while trying to verify candidate authority certificate`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "vcda_service_cert" "cloud_service_cert" {
  datacenter_id = var.cloud_vm_datacenter_id
  name          = var.cloud_vm_name
  type          = "cloud"
}
```
